### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Meets expectations

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

Excellent user stories!

* __Technical Requirements__: Meets expectations

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

Excellent job implementing flex box. It would be nice if the user could choose the number of cards, but you can implement that feature later.

* __Code Quality__: Meets expectations

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Problem Solving__: Meets expectations

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

Your readme is very helpful for me and future you! Let me know if you'd like to implement any of the unsolved problems together.
